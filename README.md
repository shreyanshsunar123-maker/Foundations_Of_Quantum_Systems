## Foundations of Quantum Systems

This repository explores foundational quantum mechanical systems from a theoretical perspective, supported by computational implementations.

Rather than focusing on numerical optimization or applications, the goal is to understand how quantum behavior arises from operators, boundary conditions, and symmetry. Each system is developed incrementally and revisited as theoretical understanding deepens.

The project is designed to evolve over time, with simple models serving as building blocks for more complex quantum structures.
